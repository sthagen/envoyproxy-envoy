  change: |
    Envoy no longer adds ``content-length: 0`` header when proxying UPGRADE requests without ``content-length`` and ``transfer-encoding`` headers.
    This behavior change can be reverted by setting the ``envoy.reloadable_features.http_skip_adding_content_length_to_upgrade`` runtime flag to false.
