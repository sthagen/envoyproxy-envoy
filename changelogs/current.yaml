behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: build
  change: |
    moved the original_dst cluster to extensions. If you use this cluster and override extensions_build_config.bzl you will now need to include it explicitly.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: cache_filter
  change: |
    add a completion callback to updateHeaders interface. Any external cache implementations will need to update to match this new interface. See changes to simple_http_cache in PR#23666 for example.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Requests which match the passthrough header now have their own metric ``oauth_passthrough`` and aren't included in ``oauth_success`` anymore.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: grpc_json_transcoder
  change: |
    fix a bug when using http2, request body has google.api.HttpBody and the size is < 16KB, it will cause EOF from the backend grpc server.
- area: router
  change: |
    fixed a bug that incorrectly rewrote the path when using ``regex_rewrite`` for redirects matched on prefix.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    fixed a bug when passthrough header was matched, envoy would always remove the authorization header. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.oauth_header_passthrough_fix`` to false.
- area: generic_proxy
  change: |
    fixed a bug that encoder filters and decoder filters of generic proxy will be executed in the same order. The encoder filters' execuate order should be the reverse of decoder filters' in the generic proxy.
- area: http
  change: |
    fixed a bug where Utility::PercentEncoding::encode() encodes some characters incorrectly because it was treating the value as negative.
